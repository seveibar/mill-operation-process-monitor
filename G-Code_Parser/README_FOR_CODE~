It is necessary to have GNUplot installed along with a compiler that supports C++11 and the Boost library.

To compile the code, run something along the lines of 
"g++ -std=c++11 G-Code_Parser.cpp -o main -lboost_iostreams -lboost_system -lboost_filesystem"

Then, run the main executable file with the Gcode file in the same directory with the Gcode file name as a parameter.
For example:
"./main gcode.txt"

After the executable file is run, you need to plot the Time vs X and Time vs Y positions with GNUplot.
Run the following commands:

gnuplot
set term png
set xlabel "Time (seconds)"
set ylabel "Displacement from Origin"
set autoscale
set output "X-Waveform.png"
plot "X-Wave.dat" using 1:2 title 'X-Position' with lines
set output "Y-Waveform.png"
plot "Y-Wave.dat" using 1:2 title 'Y-Position' with lines
set output "X_Y-Waveform.png"
plot "X-Wave.dat" using 1:2 title 'X-Position' with lines, \
"Y-Wave.dat" using 1:2 title 'Y-Position' with lines
quit

This will output the waveforms in png files in the same directory as the code. 
Future revision will autogenerate the png files in the code.
